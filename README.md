The business application of this algorithm is that classified websites can directly use this algorithm to predict prices of new properties that are going to be listed by taking some input variables and predicting the correct and justified price i.e., avoid taking price inputs from customers and thus not letting any error creeping in the system.
By using different machine learning algorithms like KNN regressor, OLS regression I have done the price prediction.
Model training accuracy is 98.40% and Model testing acuuracy is 49.11%
